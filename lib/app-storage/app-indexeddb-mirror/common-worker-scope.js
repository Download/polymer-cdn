/**
 * This file is a light-weight shim around the current Worker scope. It is
 * assumed that this file is only ever loaded in a standard WebWorker scope.
 * The location of the current worker is parsed, and the query string value
 * is treated as the URL for a secondary script payload to import into the
 * current scope.
 *
 * The shim listens for messages, and if it receives one with data of the form
 * `{"type":"common-worker-connect"}`, it dispatches a global "connect" event
 * (intended to be semantically similar to the same event in a `SharedWorker`
 * scope), echoing the original `MessageEvent`'s ports.
 *
 * This allows a category of worker scripts that would ordinarilly expect to
 * be running in a `SharedWorker` scope to run with similar expectations
 * inside of a normal `WebWorker` scope.
